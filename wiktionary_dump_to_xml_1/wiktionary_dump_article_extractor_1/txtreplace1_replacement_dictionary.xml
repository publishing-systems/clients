      You can't have escaped "&nbsp;" and unescaped "&" in the Wikitext at the same time!
      Either it is XML escaped or it is not. Maybe the idea is that with nbsp (non-breaking
      space) escaping in the Wikitext, the nbsp stays visible for the authors and the Mediawiki
      renderer has some special replacement handling code for it. The export (dumpBackup.php?)
      does not. Wikitext isn't XML or XHTML anyway, so XML/XHTML entities are not supposed to
      occur.
